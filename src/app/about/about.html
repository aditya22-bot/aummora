    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      Aumorra International began with a simple ambition — to showcase India’s rich herbal heritage
      and natural resources to the world. With strong roots in agriculture and an understanding of
      global product demands, we started our journey as a small export and ecommerce-driven company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, Aumorra International has expanded into a multi-category, export-focused brand serving
      clients across Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. While we’ve grown, our core belief
      remains unchanged:
      <strong>quality first, relationships forever, and transparency at every step.</strong>
